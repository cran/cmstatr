\title{Glance at an \code{equiv_mean_extremum} object}
\usage{
\method{glance}{equiv_mean_extremum}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an equiv_mean_extremum object returned from
\code{\link{equiv_mean_extremum}}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. Not used. Included only to match generic
signature.}
}
\value{
A one-row \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble}} with the following
columns:

\item{\code{alpha}}{the value of alpha passed to this function}
\item{\code{n_sample}}{the number of observations in the sample for which
  equivalency is being checked. This is either the value \code{n_sample}
  passed to this function or the length of the vector \code{data_sample}.}
\item{\code{modcv}}{logical value indicating whether the acceptance
  thresholds are calculated using the modified CV approach}
\item{\code{threshold_min_indiv}}{The calculated threshold value for
  minimum individual}
\item{\code{threshold_mean}}{The calculated threshold value for mean}
\item{\code{result_min_indiv}}{a character vector of either "PASS" or
  "FAIL" indicating whether the data from \code{data_sample} passes the
  test for minimum individual. If \code{data_sample} was not supplied,
  this value will be \code{NULL}}
\item{\code{result_mean}}{a character vector of either "PASS" or
  "FAIL" indicating whether the data from \code{data_sample} passes the
  test for mean. If \code{data_sample} was not supplied, this value will
  be  \code{NULL}}
\item{\code{min_sample}}{The minimum value from the vector
  \code{data_sample}. if \code{data_sample} was not supplied, this will
  have a value of \code{NULL}}
\item{\code{mean_sample}}{The mean value from the vector
  \code{data_sample}. If \code{data_sample} was not supplied, this will
  have a value of \code{NULL}}
}
\description{
Glance accepts an object of type \code{equiv_mean_extremum} and returns a
\code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble}} with
one row of summaries.

Glance does not do any calculations: it just gathers the results in a
tibble.
